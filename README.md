### Jellyfish video analysis Python programs I created for Professor Richard Harland's Jellydreamers lab. 
### PulseLocator.py
analyzes Jellyfish video frame-by-frame to segment the video by Jellyfish movement and to also filter out the frames in which the Jellyfish is not pulsing, massively increasing the speed of the pipeline's subsequent Pulse Analysis program. 
### Automatedsteps.py 
combines the steps of running scripts, converting videos to image stacks, creating files/folders, etc. that lab researchers previously had to manually perform so that less tedious work needs to be done and video analysis can run for days on end without needing someone to manage the state of the program every few hours.
